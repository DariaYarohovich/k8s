# PVC - Persistent Volume Claim
# What is "volume" in the kubernetes world
#Â - it is an object (data storage INSIDE the pod) that allows a container to store data at the POD LEVEL
# When a container is created inside of a pod any data is written in the filesystem inside of thi scontainer.
# If container crashes all the data is lost. BAD.
# Volume is tied to the POD. So data is written not in the filysystem of a container, but outside of it. Thus, if a container crashes, data is kept. But if POD dies, data is lost too.

# What is "Persistent Volume"
# persistent volume is NOT tied to a pod, it is outside of a pod.

# What is "Persistent Volume Claim"
# It is like a list of available persistent volumes (can be compared with an advertisement)
